# Academic Archive: C & C++ Course Projects 🎓

This repository serves as a **portfolio of exercises and code snippets** completed during my Electronics-ICT studies (2021-2023).  
It includes references to larger projects hosted in their own repositories and smaller learning exercises.

---

## Note

> These projects were completed during my second year to practice **C and C++ programming** and **object-oriented programming (OOP)**.  
> This repository is archived for portfolio purposes.

## Completed Projects

### C Version

- **[Minesweeper](https://github.com/JonasVanhulst/minesweeper-c)**  
  Classic Minesweeper game in C. Instructor provided the game logic; my implementation handled user interaction and save/load functionality.

- **[Texas Hold’em Bot (C)](https://github.com/JonasVanhulst/texas-holdem-learning-bot/tree/main/texas-holdem-c/2EAI-Cpp-texas-holdem-c-master/2EAI-Cpp-texas-holdem-c-master)**  
  Poker bot implemented in C. Game logic provided by the instructor; my implementation handled the bot strategy.

### C++ Version

- **[Texas Hold’em Bot (C++)](https://github.com/JonasVanhulst/texas-holdem-learning-bot/tree/main/texas-holdem-cpp/2EAI-Cpp-texas-holdem-cpp-master/2EAI-Cpp-texas-holdem-cpp-master)**  
  Rewritten from C to C++ with **OOP design**. Bot logic implemented by me and integrated with instructor-provided classes.
